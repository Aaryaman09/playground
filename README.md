# Playground

Playground hosts Pommerman, a clone of Bomberman built for AI research. People from around the world submit agents that they've trained to play. We run regular competitions on our servers and report the results and replays.

#### If you are here for the first time, check out our [website](www.pommerman.com) for more information and our [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/wjVJEDc) to join the community.

There are three variants for which you can enter your agents to compete:

* FFA
> This is a Free For All where four agents enter and one leaves. It tests planning, tactics, and cunning.
* Team 
> This is a 2v2 where two teams of agents enter and one team wins. It tests cooperation, planning, and tactics.
* Team Radio
> This is like Team but each agent has a radio that they can use to convey two words each step from a dictionary of size 8.

#### Why should I participate?

* You are a machine learning researcher and similarly recognize the lack of approachable benchmarks for this subfield. Help us rectify this and prove that your algorithm is better than others.
* You want to contribute to multi agent or communication research. This is first and foremost a platform for doing research and everything that we do here will eventually get published with generous (or primary) support from us.
* You really like(d) Bomberman and are fascinated by AI. This is a great opportunity to learn how to build intelligent agents.
* You want the glory of winning an AI competition. We are going to publicize the results widely.
* You think AI is dumb and can make a deterministic system that beats any learned agent.

#### How do I train agents?



#### How do I submit agents that I have trained?

The setup for submitting agents will be live shortly. It involves making a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) container that runs your agent. We then read and upload your docker file via Github OAuth. You retain the ownership and license of the agents. We will not look at or use your code; we are just going to run your agent in competitions on our servers. We have an example agent that already works and further instructions are in the games/a/docker directory.

#### Who is running this?

[Cinjon Resnick](http://twitter.com/cinjoncin), [Denny Britz](https://twitter.com/dennybritz), and [David Ha](https://twitter.com/hardmaru) are the folks behind this. We are generously supported by a host of other people, including [Kyunghyun Cho](https://twitter.com/kchonyc), [Joan Bruna](https://twitter.com/joanbruna) and [Jason Weston](https://research.fb.com/people/weston-jason/). You can find us in the [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/wjVJEDc).
